**OneUptime: The Complete Open-Source Observability Platform**

OneUptime is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing your online services. Whether you need to check the availability of your website, dashboard, API, or any other online resource, OneUptime can alert your team when downtime happens and keep your customers informed with a status page. OneUptime also helps you handle incidents, set up on-call rotations, run tests, secure your services, analyze logs, track performance, and debug errors.

OneUptime replaces multiple tools with one integrated platform:

-   **Uptime Monitoring**: Monitor the availability and response time of your online services from multiple locations around the world. Get notified via email, SMS, Slack, or other channels when something goes wrong. Replace tools like Pingdom.
-   **Status Page**: Communicate with your customers and stakeholders during downtime or maintenance. Create a custom-branded status page that shows the current status and history of your services. Replace tools like StatusPage.io.
-   **Incident Management**: Manage incidents from start to finish with a collaborative workflow. Create incident reports, assign tasks, update stakeholders, and document resolutions. Replace tools like Incident.io.
-   **On-call Rotation and Alerts**: Schedule on-call shifts for your team and define escalation policies. Ensure that the right person is notified at the right time when an incident occurs. Replace tools like PagerDuty.
-   **Tests** (Coming soon): Automate testing of your online services with scripts or scenarios. Verify the functionality and performance of your APIs, web pages, or workflows. Replace tools like Postman.
-   **Logs Management** (Coming soon): Collect, store, and analyze logs from your online services. Search, filter, and visualize log data to gain insights and troubleshoot issues. Replace tools like Loggly.
-   **Performance Monitoring** (Coming soon): Measure and optimize the performance of your online services. Track key metrics such as response time, throughput, error rate, and user satisfaction. Replace tools like NewRelic.
-   **Error Tracking** (Coming soon): Detect and diagnose errors in your online services. Get detailed error reports with stack traces, context, and user feedback. Replace tools like Sentry.
